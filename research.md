# One Large Fan vs. Several Smaller Fans #
  * Hypothesis:  Several small fans, such as high volume computer case fans, might be able to replace the existing single large fan in the original Baals wind tunnel design.
  * Reasoning:  The smaller computer case fans were designed to be controlled by computer via pulse width modulation, and provide a fairly easy to read rpm pin.  The large single motor does not provide a rpm gauge, and will be more difficult to setup with computer control.
  * Research:  If the parts that are installed in the existing Baals wind tunnel from the HOSC are the same as on this web page (http://www.ceeo.tufts.edu/robolabatceeo/College/windtunnel/baals.shtml) then the grainger part listing states that this fan can deliver 3000+ CFM @ 1725 RPM with no obstructions in front of the fan / ducting.  Since I'm not sure how the wind tunnel will obstruct the flow, I'm going to assume the worse case listed in the grainger catalog for the fan blade (2500+ CFM @ 1725 RPM).
A high volume case fan I found on NewEgg.com (http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16835706041) lists 108 CFM @ 8000 RPM.  The design of the Baals wind tunnel could potentially let us stack 3 of these 80 mm case fans side by side, and 3 top to bottom for a total of 9 fans and a CFM rating of close to 972 CFM at 8000 RPM with all fans on.  To reach 2500 CFM we would need ~24 case fans, which, while possible would require larger modifications to the original Baals design.
